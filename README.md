Solutions and hints to Kattis problems.

## How to Contribute

### Directory Names
Each problem should have its own directory whose name matches the problem's ID. The problem ID can be found just below the "Submit" button, or at the end of the URL of the problem page. If there is no directory for the problem that you have a solution for, create one.

### Filenames
The name of your file should be `[github_username].[file_ext]`. If you commit multiple solutions, each solution past the first should have a hyphen and the solution number appended to the filename. For example, if I have a GitHub username of `john123` and I have three different Python solutions to the problem with ID `hello`, then I would name my files `/hello/john123.py`, `/hello/john123-2.py`, and `/hello/john123-3.py`. Renaming the initial solution file to include `-1` at the end of the filename is optional.

### Template Files
Starter code template files should be placed in a subdirectory named `template` in the directory of the problem that the template code is for. There should be no more than one template file per programming language in each `template` directory.
